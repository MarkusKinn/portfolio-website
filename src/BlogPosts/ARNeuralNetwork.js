                Between Theory and Visualization</h1>

            <section className="mb-8">
                <p>Developing an Augmented Reality (AR) application to visualize and interact with neural networks in
                    real-time has been an exhilarating journey into the intersection of immersive technology and machine
                    learning. This project not only pushed the boundaries of how we can understand complex AI concepts
                    but also opened up new possibilities for interactive education in the field of neural networks. In
                    this blog post, I'll delve into the technical intricacies of the implementation, discussing the core
                    components, challenges faced, and insights gained.</p>

            <section className="mb-8">
                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Essence of AR for Neural Networks</h2>
                <p>At its core, this AR application aims to demystify the often abstract concept of neural networks by
                    providing a tangible, interactive 3D representation. By leveraging the power of AR, we can now
                    observe the inner workings of a neural network as it processes data, making the learning process
                    more intuitive and engaging.</p>
                <p className="mt-4">The key innovation lies in the real-time visualization and interaction capabilities.
                    Users can not only see a static representation of a neural network but also observe how data flows
                    through the network, how weights are adjusted during training, and how the network's decision-making
                    process evolves over time.</p>

            <section className="mb-8">
                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">AR Framework and 3D Rendering</h2>
                <p>The application is built using Unity and AR Foundation, providing a robust and flexible framework for
                    creating AR experiences across multiple platforms. The neural network itself is rendered using
                    custom shaders and particle systems to create a visually appealing and informative
                    representation.</p>
                <p className="mt-4">Each neuron is represented as a 3D sphere, with synapses visualized as lines
                    connecting these spheres. The thickness and color of these lines represent the weight and activation
                    of the connections. The network's layers are arranged in 3D space, allowing users to walk around and
                    examine the network from different angles.</p>

            <section className="mb-8">
                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Interactive Network Building</h2>
                <p>One of the core features of the application is the ability to construct neural networks in real-time
                    within the AR environment. Users can add layers, specify the number of neurons in each layer, and
                    choose activation functions through intuitive gesture-based interactions.</p>
                <p className="mt-4">The network architecture is defined by a series of layer objects, each containing
                    information about its neurons and connections:</p>
                <pre className="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-md overflow-x-auto">
                    <code className="text-sm">
                        {`struct Layer {
                            int neuronCount;
                            ActivationFunction activationFunction;
                            List<Neuron> neurons;
                            List<Connection> connections;
                        }`}
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p className="mt-4">As users modify the network structure, the application dynamically updates the 3D
                    representation, providing immediate visual feedback.</p>

            <section className="mb-8">
                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Real-time Training Visualization</h2>
                <p>Perhaps the most captivating aspect of the application is its ability to visualize the training
                    process in real-time. Users can input training data through various AR interfaces (e.g., drawing
                    numbers in the air, capturing real-world objects), and watch as the network processes this
                    information.</p>
                <p className="mt-4">The backpropagation algorithm, central to training neural networks, is visualized as
                    a flow of colored particles moving backwards through the network. The color and intensity of these
                    particles represent the magnitude and direction of weight updates:</p>
                <BlockMath>{"\\Delta w_{ij} = \\eta \\cdot \\delta_j \\cdot a_i"}</BlockMath>
                <p className="mt-2">Where <InlineMath>{"\\Delta w_{ij}"}</InlineMath> is the weight
                    update, <InlineMath>\eta</InlineMath> is the learning
                    rate, <InlineMath>{"\\delta_j"}</InlineMath> is the error term for neuron j,
                    and <InlineMath>{"a_i"}</InlineMath> is the activation of neuron i.</p>
