            <section className="mb-8">
                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What is SAHI?</h2>
                <p>Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) is an innovative technique in the field of computer vision, specifically designed to enhance object detection in large, high-resolution images. At its core, SAHI is a method that intelligently divides large images into smaller, more manageable pieces, processes each piece separately, and then recombines the results to provide a comprehensive analysis of the entire image.</p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Problems SAHI Solves</h2>
                <p>SAHI addresses several critical challenges in object detection:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Small Object Detection:</strong> Traditional models often struggle to identify small objects in large images. SAHI's slicing approach allows for better detection of these smaller elements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scale Variance:</strong> Objects of vastly different sizes in the same image can be problematic for standard detectors. SAHI helps maintain consistent performance across various scales.</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory Limitations:</strong> Processing extremely large images can be memory-intensive. SAHI's piece-by-piece approach allows for handling of much larger images than conventional methods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Edge Case Handling:</strong> Objects at the edges or corners of images are often missed. SAHI's overlapping slices ensure these edge cases are properly addressed.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How SAHI Works</h2>
                <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Image Slicing:</strong> The large input image is divided into smaller, overlapping slices. The size of these slices and the degree of overlap are adjustable parameters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Individual Processing:</strong> Each slice is independently processed by the object detection model. This allows the model to focus on a smaller area, potentially improving its ability to detect objects that might be missed in the full-scale image.</li>
                    <li><strong>Result Aggregation:</strong> The detections from all slices are combined. This step involves resolving overlapping detections and adjusting bounding boxes to account for the slicing process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-processing:</strong> Final adjustments are made to ensure coherent results. This often includes techniques like Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to remove duplicate detections.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Pros of SAHI</h2>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Improved Small Object Detection:</strong> By processing smaller slices, SAHI significantly enhances the model's ability to detect small objects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scale Invariance:</strong> SAHI helps models perform consistently across different scales, from very small to very large objects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory Efficiency:</strong> The slice-by-slice approach allows for processing of much larger images than traditional methods, overcoming memory constraints.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> SAHI can be used with virtually any object detection model, making it a versatile tool in various computer vision pipelines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Edge and Corner Detection:</strong> The overlapping slice approach ensures objects at image boundaries are not missed.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Cons and Challenges of SAHI</h2>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Increased Computation Time:</strong> Processing multiple slices can be more time-consuming than processing a single, full-sized image.</li>
                    <li><strong>Potential for Duplicates:</strong> Objects spanning multiple slices may be detected multiple times, requiring careful post-processing to resolve.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parameter Tuning:</strong> Optimal slice size and overlap can vary depending on the specific use case and image characteristics, requiring careful tuning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complexity in Implementation:</strong> Implementing SAHI effectively requires additional logic for slicing, result aggregation, and post-processing, increasing system complexity.</li>
